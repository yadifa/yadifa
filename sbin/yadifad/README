20141214:
        YADIFA 2.0.4

        This release is a public release

        Improved build mechanism.
            It has been tested to work automatically on Linux, FreeBSD, OSX, SunOS.
            RedHat familly builds will use -O2 as maximum optimisations.

        Fixes:
        - fixed an issue with the AXFR transfer where the serial number would not be properly taken into account
        - fixed an issue with bogus DNSKEY records that may potentially lead to a crash in openssl
        - fixed a reported potential "tmpfile" vulnerability on DEBUG builds (generated with make debug)
        - fixed an issue with IPv6 connections on some architectures
        - typos fixes
        - minor fixes and improvements

20141104:
        Architecture portability enhancements.

        On Solaris, if no --enable-force32bits nor --enable-force64bits is set, then 64 bits will be forced (fixes an issue at link-time)

    This release is a public release

    - --disable-master feature at configure now builds a slave-only server

    Fixes:
    - fixed an issue with TSIG signed queries
    - fixed an issue with thread pool live resizing
    - fixed an issue where reading an undeleted obsolete journal ending at the start of a newly transferred zone from the master would incorrectly trigger an error

    Known issue:
    - removing the last key of a signed zone is permitted by YADIFA but triggers some chicken-egg issue with signatures.


20140630:
    YADIFA 2.0.0-beta2-public

    This release is a public release

    - basepath disabled
    - pidpath removed, only pidfile remains
    - log reopen notification is now timestamped

    - default logging settings no longer output debug

    Fixes:
    - fixed issue in flag computation (AD,CD)
    - fixed an issue with journal truncation sometimes leading to a crash
    - zone parsing now correctly accepts '#' as a comment marker
    - zone parsing now rejects wrong fqdn as soon as it reads them, leading to a more accurate error message
    - removing the last dnskey of a zone no longer crashes the server

    Known issue:
    - removing the last key of a signed zone is permitted by YADIFA but triggers some chicken-egg issue with signatures.

    yadifa remote client commands prototype is now available with the following supported commands:

        -shutdown
            shuts down yadifa
            e.g. ./yadifa -s "192.0.2.1 port 53" -t shutdown
            
        -cfgreload
            reloads the <key> and <zone> sections of the yadifad configuration

            e.g. ./yadifa -s "192.0.2.1 port 53" -t cfgreload

        -logreopen
            closes and reopen the log files

            e.g. ./yadifa -s "192.0.2.1 port 53" -t logreopen

        -freezeall
            prevents all zones from being updated dynamically with nsupdate
            
            e.g. ./yadifa -s "192.0.2.1 port 53" -t freezeall

        -freeze
            prevents a zone from being updated dynamically with nsupdate

            e.g. ./yadifa -s "192.0.2.1 port 53" -t freeze -q somedomain.eu

        -unfreezeall
            enables updates of all zones again

            e.g. ./yadifa -s "192.0.2.1 port 53" -t unfreezeall

        -unfreeze
            enables updates of a zone again

            e.g. ./yadifa -s "192.0.2.1 port 53" -t unfreeze -q somedomain.eu

        In order to work, the allow-control ACL must be defined either in <main> for the global commands and
        may also be defined in <zone> for the ones targeting a specific zone.

            e.g. allow-control 127.0.0.1

        Note that tsig is not supported in the client yet.

20130612:
    YADIFA 1.0.3
        Fixes only (backports from 1.1.0)

		  By default YADIFA will not use parallel processing as this feature has not been
		  as thoroughly tested as the single-thread processing model
		_ default parameters tuning
		_ fixes

	 Known issue:
		_ on 32 bits architectures, the sig-validity-* fields are not properly copied from <main> to <zone>

20120319:
	YADIFA 1.0.0RC1

	Is a full functional authoritative name server:

		- works as primary or secondary name server
		- AXFR
		- IXFR
		- NOTIFY
		- NSUPDATE
		- TSIG
		- CLASSES:
			- IN
			- CH (just for version)
		- TYPES:
			- AAAA
			- CNAME
			- DNSKEY
			- DS
			- HINFO
			- MX
			- NAPTR
			- NS
			- NSEC3
			- NSEC3PARAM
			- NSEC
			- PTR
			- RRSIG
			- SOA
			- SRV
			- SSHFP
			- TXT
		- Automatic resigning
		- DNSSEC algorithms:
			- 5 (RSASHA1)
			- 7 (RSASHA1-NSEC3
		- ACL's
	

	KNOWN ISSUES:

		NSEC3:	_ cannot work with multiple NSEC3PARAM chains with mixed OPT-IN/OUT settings

			_ adding a new NSEC3 chain expects that the master sends the NSEC3PARAM first (it does not seems to be always the case)
				  We have a case where a master starts with 2 thousands NSEC3 opt-out records then adds 6 millions NSEC3 opt-in records but does not give the NSEC3PARAM record
				  first. The slave server rejects them all because it's unable to link them to a chain.  (This one has high priority)

		DNSSEC:	_ it is not allowed to change the zone security mode (unsecure, NSEC, or NSEC3).  Once the zone is loaded it keeps its security mode.

			_ dynamic updates of NSEC as well as NSEC3 records are refused

		QUIT:	the server will shutdown on the following conditions:

			_ detection of an impossible situation or an internal integrity issue (ie: for any reason the SOA has vanished from a zone)

			_ memory limit reached which prevents any more work

			_ ipc issue which prevent internal services communication

		ACL:	_ since the access control is set by zone and CHAOS class is not implemented as a configurable zone, it is not possible (yet) to specifically block CHAOS queries.

20111121:
	YADIFA 0.5.5
		-	many fixes

		-	TSIG queries are checked
		-	Replays the zone journal on startup after the zone load (journaling)
		-	Answers IXFR queries (journaling)

20110601:
	YADIFA 0.4.0
		Operational:
		-	It works as a no dnssec name server
		-	No notifies to slave name servers
		-	daemon
		-	Answers AXFR queries with TSIG
		- 	nsupdate functionality (journaling)
		-	TSIG on client server side will be transmitted, but not checked

		-	No notifies to slave name servers
		-	daemon
		-	Answers AXFR queries
		- 	The zone has SOA, NS A resource records.
		

20091224:
	YADIFA 0.2.0
		_	Answers AXFR queries
		_	ACL based on IP and TSIG (not all query types are ACL'ed yet)

20091104:
	YADIFA 0.1.0

		YADIFA is a work in progress. The main goal is to have an alternative for BIND or NSD.

		Version 0.1.0 is an authoritative server only. 

		It has no:
		-	AXFR/IXFR functionality
		-	dynupdate
		- 	support for NSEC
		- 	support for NSEC3
		-	caching mechanism
		- 	additional tools (eg.dig, dnssectools, drill,...)

		It has:
		-	a very fast way to give authoritative answer
		-	a very fast method for loading the database and checking the zone files

		This first release is to have a feeling how it works in an operational environment.
	
	TODO

		Everything what is not implemented, has to be implemented. Most of the code is there, but is not activated.

		No comformity tests has been done. (This of course is on the todo list)
